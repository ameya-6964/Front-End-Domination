# HTML Basics

## What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It is the foundation of any web page and provides the basic structure for organizing content on the internet. HTML allows you to define the structure and layout of a document by using a set of elements and tags.

## HTML Basics Tags

HTML uses tags to define elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs â€“ an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between these tags represents the structure or information that the tag defines.

Here are some fundamental HTML tags:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the HTML version being used (HTML5, in this case).

2. `<html>`: The root element that wraps around the entire HTML document.

3. `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title and linked stylesheets.

4. `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. `<body>`: Encloses the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.

6. `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading tags define headings in descending order of importance. `<h1>` is the highest level, and `<h6>` is the lowest.

7. `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

8. `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink, allowing users to navigate to another page or resource.

9. `<img>`: Embeds an image into the document.

10. `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Used to create unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.

11. `<div>`: Divides the content into sections, allowing you to apply styles or structure the page.

12. `<span>`: Inline equivalent of the `<div>` tag, used for applying styles or scripting to a specific portion of text.
