# Semantic Tags in HTML

HTML5 introduced a set of semantic tags to provide more meaningful structure and convey the purpose of different parts of a web page. These tags enhance the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall understanding of the document structure.

## Definition of Semantic Tags

**Semantic Tags:**
Semantic tags are HTML elements that carry meaning about the structure and content of the web page. They provide information about the role that the enclosed content plays on the page, making it easier for developers and browsers to understand the purpose and context of each element.

## Examples of Semantic Tags

1. `<header>`: Represents a header for its nearest section or article ancestor.
2. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.
3. `<nav>`: Represents a navigation menu.
4. `<section>`: Represents a generic section of a document or application.

## Non-Semantic Tags

**Non-Semantic Tags:**
Non-semantic tags, in contrast, do not inherently convey any meaning about the content they enclose. They are used purely for formatting and presentation purposes.

## Difference Between Semantic and Non-Semantic Tags

1. **Meaning and Purpose:**

   - **Semantic Tags:** Carry meaning about the content and structure of the page.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags:** Used for presentation and styling, without conveying inherent meaning.

2. **Accessibility:**

   - **Semantic Tags:** Enhance accessibility by providing a clear document structure.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags:** May not contribute to document structure or accessibility.

3. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**

   - **Semantic Tags:** Contribute to better SEO as search engines can better understand the content hierarchy.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags:** May not provide as much information to search engines about the document structure.

4. **Readability and Maintenance:**

   - **Semantic Tags:** Improve code readability and make it easier to maintain and update.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags:** Code may be less readable, especially in larger projects.

5. **Default Styling:**
   - **Semantic Tags:** Often come with default styling that can be modified or overridden.
   - **Non-Semantic Tags:** May require more effort for styling as they don't have inherent meaning.

In summary, using semantic tags is recommended for building well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly web pages, while non-semantic tags are typically used for layout and presentation purposes. It's best practice to strike a balance between both types of tags to create maintainable and meaningful HTML documents.
